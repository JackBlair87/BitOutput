Bit Output Pin Library for Arduino
-
This library counts in binary outputting the bits to the first N pins. The library comes with some samples that show how to use the library.

_____________________________________________
Methods:
1. BitOutput(int pinCount, double newDelay, boolean print) --> creates a new BitOutput with the number of pins to output to, the counting delay, and whehter or not it should print to the Serial Monitor. The most significant bit is pin 13. 
2. begin() --> runs the output indefinitley.
